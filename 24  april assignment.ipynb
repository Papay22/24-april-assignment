    "In the context of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a projection is a way to represent high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space. Specifically, PCA projects high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional subspace that captures the most important information in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The projection is achieved by finding the principal components of the data, which are the directions in the high-dimensional space that capture the most variation in the data. These principal components form a new basis for the data, and the projection of each data point onto this new basis gives its representation in the lower-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have a dataset with 100 features (i.e., 100 dimensions), we can use PCA to project this data onto a lower-dimensional space, say 2 dimensions. The first principal component captures the direction of maximum variance in the data, and the second principal component captures the direction of maximum variance orthogonal to the first component. We can then project each data point onto these two principal components to obtain its representation in the 2D subspace.\n",

    "The optimization problem in Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is to find the linear transformation that best captures the most important information in the data.

The elbow point or inflection point in these plots can be used as a guide for selecting an appropriate number of principal components.\n",
